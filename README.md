# Covid-19 - Tools and Notebooks for Geographic Analysis

## Animation of Infection Rates
Visualizing Covid-19 infection rates over time can be done in a single animation. The animation is made by loading a CSV file as a pandas dataframe and plotting each column with a world shapefile, the maps can then be combined in to a single gif. <br>
Infection data for the world animation is the daily number of new reported COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)

Similar animations can likewise be made for regions in the European union or municipalities on a country level.
